    What’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal,
    how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual
    twins Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English in one week,
    to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods.
</p>
<p>
    They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day
    life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable
    language learners at work.
</p>

<p>
    The twins set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch
    themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented
    itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital,
    and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Truly understanding one’s environment requires one to first understand English</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    The first operational step in the twins learning process was to decorate the entire apartment
    with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the twins delved into dictionaries
    and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name.
</p>

<p>
    Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making
    a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three
    different words related to this action.
</p>

<p>
    The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara
    delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was
    augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact
    that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that
    each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
</p>

    <p>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    The twins simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee.
</p>
<p>
    Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week. On the first day they were visited by a
    English friend who greeted them in English and complimented them on how quickly they’d picked up
    their first words and phrases.
</p>
<p>
    They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit
    the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats).
    Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with
    pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

<p>
    On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.
</p>

<p>
    Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and
    various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks.
</p>
<p>
    There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the
    eight hours that the twins had allotted to it.
</p>
<p>
    They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English,
    this being the root of their success.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>you will likely come across words that share common origins with your native tongue</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    The twins spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their
    way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio
    stations and write-ups of&nbsp;English football games on the web.
</p>

<blockquote class="td_pull_quote td_pull_right">
    <p>There is no definitive method to learn a language fluently</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then
    refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats barely have any contact with
    other speakers and that’s not enough.
</p>

<p>
    The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true
    if the problem we’re trying to solve is learning a new language.

<p>
    Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning
    of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement
    sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.
</p>

<p>
    To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave
    them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep,
    while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the
    word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.
